I\textquotesingle{}m too lazy to figure out how to make the parser support comments, so here\textquotesingle{}s what each line means


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item First line is the title of the window
\item Second line is the width and height, expressed as {\ttfamily width height}
\item Third line is the framerate limit (maximum FPS)
\item Fourth line is whether or not to enable vertical sync 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
