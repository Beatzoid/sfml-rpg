# Window.ini

I'm too lazy to figure out how to make the parser support comments, so here's what each line means

1. First line is the title of the window
2. Second line is the width and height, expressed as `width height`
3. Third line is the framerate limit (maximum FPS)
4. Fourth line is whether or not to enable vertical sync
